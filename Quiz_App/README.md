## Project Description

An interactive quiz application that allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, track their scores, save progress, and manage time. This project is built using JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and Local Storage. The app focuses on event handling, array methods, and client-side functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Environment**: Ensure you have the following tools installed:
    - Node.js (for backend setup and testing)
    - A code editor like VS Code or Zed IDE
    - A browser for frontend testing

---

### 1. **Backend Setup**

### **1.1. Initialize the Project**

- Create a new project folder: `quiz-app`.
- Open a terminal in the project folder and initialize a Node.js project:
    
    ```bash
    npm init -y
    
    ```
    
- Install necessary dependencies if you plan to use them (e.g., `express` for testing APIs):
    
    ```bash
    npm install express body-parser cors
    
    ```
    

### **1.2. Create a Basic Server (Optional)**

- Set up a simple `server.js` file for serving data (if needed). This step is optional since the app primarily focuses on frontend functionality. However, this can be useful for future scalability.

### **1.3. Define Question Management Logic**

- Create a `data` folder to hold quiz-related files (e.g., `questions.json`) to store questions and answers.
- Create mock APIs for:
    - Fetching questions
    - Submitting scores

### **1.4. Test APIs**

- Use tools like Postman or browser-based fetch requests to verify your APIs.

### 2. **Frontend Setup**

### **2.1. Initialize the Frontend**

- Inside the project folder, create the following directory structure:
    
    ```
    quiz-app/
    ├── index.html
    ├── style.css
    ├── script.js
    └── assets/
    
    ```
    
- Add placeholder files:
    - `index.html` for the HTML structure
    - `style.css` for styling
    - `script.js` for JavaScript logic
    - `assets/` folder for images or other media files

### **2.2. Design the UI**

1. **Basic Layout**
    - Create a clean and responsive layout in `index.html` with:
        - A quiz container
        - A timer display
        - A score tracker
        - Buttons for navigation (Next, Submit)
    - Use semantic HTML tags.
2. **Style with CSS**
    - Design the UI with a focus on user experience (e.g., responsive buttons, readable fonts, and interactive feedback).

### **2.3. Add Core Functionality**

1. **Load Questions**
    - Use JavaScript to dynamically fetch and display questions.
    - Store questions in an array and shuffle them using array methods.
2. **Event Handling**
    - Add event listeners for user actions:
        - Selecting an answer
        - Clicking "Next"
        - Submitting the quiz
3. **Score Tracking**
    - Maintain a score variable in JavaScript to track correct answers.
    - Display the score in real-time.
4. **Timer**
    - Implement a countdown timer to limit quiz duration.
    - Reset or stop the timer on quiz completion.
5. **Save Progress**
    - Use `localStorage` to:
        - Save the user's current question and score.
        - Load progress if the user returns.

### **2.4. Test and Debug**

- Verify all functionality:
    - Navigation between questions
    - Timer resets and updates
    - Proper saving/loading of progress
    - User feedback for correct/incorrect answers

---

### 3. **Finalizing the Project**

1. **Enhancements**
    - Add animations or transitions for a better user experience.
    - Include accessibility features (e.g., keyboard navigation).
2. **Cross-Browser Testing**
    - Test the app in multiple browsers to ensure compatibility.
3. **Deployment**
    - Use GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel to deploy the app.
    - Share the link to showcase your work.
